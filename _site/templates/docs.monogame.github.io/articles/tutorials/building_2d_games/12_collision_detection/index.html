<p>In <a href="../11_input_management/index.html">Chapter 11</a>, you learned how to manage player input to control game objects. However, for objects in your game to interact with each other, collecting items, hitting obstacles, or triggering events, you need to detect when these objects come into contact. This is accomplished through collision detection.</p>
<p>In this chapter you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand different collision shapes and their use cases.</li>
<li>Implement rectangle-based collision detection.</li>
<li>Create circle-based collision detection.</li>
<li>Learn how to handle object overlap and response.</li>
<li>Build a reusable collision system for your game.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will first start by understanding the basics of collision detection and the different approaches that can be used.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>There is a lot to understand when it comes to collision detection and the many complex ways that two objects can be considered IN collision or NEAR collision. It is critical to get an understanding of the basics before jumping into code. So buckle up, we have a story to tell before you can get back to the keyboard.</p>
<p>Feel free to keep coming back to this chapter and refer to the content when you need to, with a fresh cup of coffee.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="understanding-collision-detection">Understanding Collision Detection</h2>
<p>Before we start implementing collision detection, we should discuss what collision detection actually is. In 2D games, collision detection involves checking if two objects interact with each other in some way. There are several approaches to detecting collisions, ranging from simple to complex:</p>
<h3 id="proximity-collision-detection">Proximity Collision Detection</h3>
<p>The simplest form is checking if objects are within a certain range of each other. This is useful when you only need to know if objects are &quot;near&quot; each other like detecting if an enemy is close enough to chase a player or if two objects are close enough to perform a more complex collision check.</p>
<h3 id="simple-shape-based-collision-detection">Simple Shape Based Collision Detection</h3>
<p>Shaped based collision detection checks if two shapes overlap. The most common and simple shapes used are circles and rectangles:</p>
<h4 id="circle-collision-detection">Circle Collision Detection</h4>
<p>Circle collision detection is computationally a simpler check than rectangles. There are also no special considerations if the circles are rotated, which makes them easier to use. To determine if two circle shapes are overlapping, we only need to check if the square of the sum of the radii between the two circles is less than the squared distance between the two circles with the following formula:</p>
<p>To find the distance between two circles, imagine drawing a line from the center of one circle to the center of the other. The length of this line is the distance, but we could also calculate it by first walking up or down and then walking left or right from the center of one circle to another, forming a right triangle.</p>
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 12-1: Showing the distance between the center of two circles forms a right triangle</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In <em>Figure 12-1</em> above</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(a\)</span> is the horizontal distance between the centers of the two circles (x-axis).</li>
<li><span class="math">\(b\)</span> is the vertical distance between the centers of the two circles (y-axis).</li>
<li><span class="math">\(c\)</span> is the total distance between the centers of the two circles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since this forms a right triangle, we can use Pythagorean's Theorem to calculate <span class="math">\(c^2\)</span> given <span class="math">\(a^2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b^2\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\)</span></p>
<p>To check for overlap of two circles, we compare whether the <em>squared sum of the radii</em> of the two circles is greater than the <em>squared distance</em>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\((radius_{circle1} + radius_{circle2})^2 &gt; a^2 + b^2\)</span></p>
<p>It is easy to confuse the direction of the inequality sign. As a quick mental test, think of how the math works when the origin of two circles are at the same position, i.e., when the <em>squared distance</em> is zero.</p>
<p>To calculate the squared distance between two points, MonoGame provides the <a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.DistanceSquared(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2,Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2)"><strong>Vector2.DistanceSquared</strong></a> method:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">Vector2 circle1Position = new Vector2(8, 10);
Vector2 circle2Position = new Vector2(5, 6);

float circle1Radius = 5;
float circle2Radius = 5;

// c^2 = a^2 + b^2
// c^2 = (8 - 5)^2 + (10 - 6)^2
// c^2 = 3^2 + 4^2
// c^2 = 9 + 16
// c^2 = 25
float distanceSquared = Vector2.DistanceSquared(circle1Position, circle2Position);

// r^2 = (5 + 5)^2
// r^2 = (10)^2
// r^2 = 100
int radiiSquared = (circle1Radius + circle2Radius) * (circle1Radius + circle2Radius);

// The circles overlap because 100 is greater than 25.
if(radiiSquared &gt; distanceSquared)
{
    
}
</code></pre>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>MonoGame also provides a distance calculation method with <a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.Distance(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2,Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2)"><strong>Vector2.Distance</strong></a> which returns the distance by providing the square root of the distance squared. So why not use this instead?</p>
<p>Square root operations are more computationally complex for a CPU. So instead of getting the normal distance, which would require the square root operation, it is more efficient for the cpu to multiply the sum of the radii by itself to get the squared sum and use that for comparison instead.</p>

<h4 id="rectangle-collision-detection">Rectangle Collision Detection</h4>
<p>Rectangles, often called <em>bounding boxes</em>, typically uses what is called <em>Axis-Aligned Bounding Box</em> (AABB) collision detection to determine if two rectangle shapes overlap. Unlike circles, to perform AABB collision detection, the x- and y-axes of both rectangles must be aligned with the x- and y-axes of the screen. This is just another way of saying that the rectangles cannot be rotated.</p>

<p>MonoGame provides the <a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Rectangle"><strong>Rectangle</strong></a> struct which represents a rectangle by its position (X,Y) and size (Width,Height).

<p>To determine if two rectangles overlap using AABB collision detection, there are four conditions that need to be checked, and all four conditions must be true. Given two rectangles <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, these conditions are:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="math">\(A_{Left}\)</span> must be less than <span class="math">\(B_{Right}\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(A_{Right}\)</span> must be greater than <span class="math">\(B_{Left}\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(A_{Top}\)</span> must be less than <span class="math">\(B_{Bottom}\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(A_{Bottom}\)</span> must be greater than <span class="math">\(B_{Top}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If even a single one of these conditions is false, then the rectangles are not overlapping and thus not colliding.</p>
<p>MonoGame provides the <a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Rectangle.Intersects(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Rectangle)"><strong>Rectangle.Intersects</strong></a> method which will perform an AABB collision check for us:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">// Rectangle 1

//          ----------------

<h4 id="complex-polygon-collision-detection">Complex Polygon Collision Detection</h4>
<p>Complex polygon collision detection uses a method called <em>Separating Axis Theorem</em> (SAT) to determine if two polygon shapes overlap. SAT uses more complex calculations that can determine if any polygon shape overlaps with another polygon shape, including if they are rotated. There are performance considerations to consider when using SAT.</p>
<p>Implementing SAT is out-of-scope for this tutorial. If you are interested in further reading about this, please see the following articles as a good starting point:</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="choosing-a-collision-detection-method">Choosing a Collision Detection Method</h4>
<p>When determining which collision detection method to use, you should start with the simplest one that meets the needs of your game. If distance checks work for your game mechanic, there's no need to implement more complex shape based detections. Similarly, if a circle can represent the bounding area of a game object, start with that before moving on to rectangles.</p>
<p>Some other points to consider are</p>
<ul>
<li>Circles:
<ul>
<li>Better for round objects like balls and coins.</li>
<li>More accurate for rotating objects.</li>
<li>A simpler check for overlap than rectangles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rectangles:
<ul>
<li>Great for walls, platforms, and most game objects.</li>
<li>Easy to visualize and debug.</li>
<li>Works well with tile-based games.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="collision-detection-vs-collision-response">Collision Detection vs Collision Response</h3>
<p>Often times when talking about collision detection, the term is used to mean both the detection of overlapping shapes and what to do once a positive check has occurred. What you do after a positive collision check has occurred is called the <em>collision response</em>. Some of the common responses are:</p>
<h4 id="blocking-collision-response">Blocking Collision Response</h4>
<p>A blocking collision response is the most basic response which just prevents the two objects from overlapping. This is commonly used for walls, platforms and other solid objects. To perform a blocking collision response:</p>
<ol>
<li>Store the object’s current location and calculate the new position it should move to.</li>
<li>Check if it is overlapping an object at the new location:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If it is overlapping, then set the position to the position before it was moved.</li>
<li>If it is not overlapping, set the position to the new calculated position.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">// Store the current location.
Vector2 previousLocation = _spriteLocation;

// Calculate a new location.
Vector2 newLocation = _spriteLocation + new Vector2(10, 0);

// Create a bounding box for the sprite object.
Rectangle spriteBounds = new Rectangle(
    (int)newLocation.X,
    (int)newLocation.Y,
    (int)_sprite.Width,
    (int)_sprite.Height
);

// Create a bounding box for the blocking object.
Rectangle blockingBounds = new Rectangle(
    (int)_blockingLocation_.X,
    (int)_blockingLocation_.Y,
    (int)_blockingSprite_.Width,
    (int)_blockingSprite_.Height
);

// Detect if they are colliding
if(spriteBounds.Intersects(blockingBounds)) 
{
    // Respond by not allowing the sprite to move by setting
    // the location back to the previous location.
    newLocation = previousLocation;
}

_spriteLocation = newLocation;
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes, instead of preventing an object from moving onto another object, we want to ensure an object remains contained within a certain bounding area. MonoGame also provides the <a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Rectangle.Contains(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Rectangle)"><strong>Rectangle.Contains</strong></a> method that we can use to determine this. <a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Rectangle.Contains(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Rectangle)"><strong>Rectangle.Contains</strong></a> can check if any of the following are completely contained within the bounds of the rectangle;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Point"><strong>Point</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Rectangle"><strong>Rectangle</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2"><strong>Vector2</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if we wanted to perform a blocking collision response that ensure a sprite remained contained within the bounds of the game screen:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">// Store the current location
Vector2 previousLocation = _spriteLocation;

// Calculate a new location
Vector2 newLocation = _spriteLocation + new Vector2(10, 0);

// Create a bounding box for the sprite object
Rectangle spriteBounds = new Rectangle(
    (int)newLocation.X,
    (int)newLocation.Y,
    (int)_sprite.Width,
    (int)_sprite.Height
);

// Get the bounds of the screen as a rectangle
Rectangle screenBounds = new Rectangle(
    0,
    0,
    GraphicsDevice.PresentationParameters.BackBufferWidth,
    GraphicsDevice.PresentationParameters.BackBufferHeight
);

// Detect if the sprite is contained within the bounds of the screen
if(!screenBounds.Contains(spriteBounds)) 
{
    // Respond by not allowing the sprite to move outside the screen
    // bounds by setting the location back to the previous location.
    newLocation = previousLocation;
}

_spriteLocation = newLocation;
</code></pre>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>Use <a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.GraphicsDevice.PresentationParameters"><strong>GraphicsDevice.PresentationParameters</strong></a> to get the actual screen dimensions instead of <a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.GraphicsDeviceManager.PreferredBackBufferWidth"><strong>GraphicsDeviceManager.PreferredBackBufferWidth</strong></a> and <a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.GraphicsDeviceManager.PreferredBackBufferHeight"><strong>GraphicsDeviceManager.PreferredBackBufferHeight</strong></a>. The preferred values are only hints and may not reflect the actual back buffer size.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="trigger-collision-response">Trigger Collision Response</h4>
<p>Sometimes you want to trigger an event, rather than block movement, when a collision occurs. Common examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collecting items.</li>
<li>Activating switches.</li>
<li>Entering zones or areas.</li>
<li>Triggering cutscenes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Performing a trigger collision response is just simply checking if the game object is overlapping with the bounding area of the trigger zone, and if so trigger the event.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">// Create a bounding box for the sprite object.
Rectangle spriteBounds = new Rectangle(
    (int)_spriteLocation.X,
    (int)_spriteLocation.Y,
    (int)_sprite.Width,
    (int)_sprite.Height
);

// Detect if the sprite object is within the trigger zone.
if(_spriteBounds.Intersects(_triggerBounds))
{
    // Perform some event.
    CollectItem();

<p>For games that need objects to bounce off each other (like the ball in a Pong game), we need to calculate how their velocity should change after the collision. MonoGame provides the <a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.Reflect(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2,Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2)"><strong>Vector2.Reflect</strong></a> method to handle this calculation for us. The method needs two pieces of information:</p>
<ol>
<li>The incoming vector (the direction the object is moving in before the collision).</li>
<li>The normal vector (the direction perpendicular to the surface).</li>
</ol>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As shown in the diagram above, when an incoming vector hits a surface, it reflects at the same angle (<span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>) relative to the normal vector.</p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>Think of the normal vector like the line you'd draw perpendicular to a mirror's surface. The angle between your incoming path and this line will be the same as the angle between your reflection and this line.</p>
</div>
<p>For example, if we had a ball moving around the screen and wanted it to bounce off the edges of the screen:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">// Calculate the new position of the ball based on the velocity.
Vector2 newPosition = _ballPosition + _ballVelocity;

// Get the bounds of the ball as a rectangle.
Rectangle ballBounds = new Rectangle(
    (int)_ballPosition.X,
    (int)_ballPosition.Y,
    (int)_ball.Width,
    (int)_ball.Height
);

// Get the bounds of the screen as a rectangle.
Rectangle screenBounds = new Rectangle(
    0,
    0,
    GraphicsDevice.PresentationParameters.BackBufferWidth,
    GraphicsDevice.PresentationParameters.BackBufferHeight
);

// Detect if the ball object is within the screen bounds.
if(!screenBounds.Contains(ballBounds))
{
    // Ball would move outside the screen
    // First find the distance from the edge of the ball to each edge of the screen.
    float distanceLeft = Math.Abs(screenBounds.Left - ballBounds.Left);
    float distanceRight = Math.Abs(screenBounds.Right - ballBounds.Right);
    float distanceTop = Math.Abs(screenBounds.Top - ballBounds.Top);
    float distanceBottom = Math.Abs(screenBounds.Bottom - ballBounds.Bottom);

    // Determine which screen edge is the closest.
    float minDistance = Math.Min(
        Math.Min(distanceLeft, distanceRight),
        Math.Min(distanceTop, distanceBottom)
    );

    // Determine the normal vector based on which screen edge is the closest.
    Vector2 normal;
    if (minDistance == distanceLeft)
    {
        // Closest to the left edge.
        normal = Vector2.UnitX;
        newPosition.X = 0;
    }
    else if (minDistance == distanceRight)
    {
        // Closest to the right edge.
        normal = -Vector2.UnitX;
        newPosition.X = screenBounds.Right - _ball.Width;
    }
    else if (minDistance == distanceTop)
    {
        // Closest to the top edge.
        normal = Vector2.UnitY;
        newPosition.Y = 0;
    }
    else
    {
        // Closest to the bottom edge.
        normal = -Vector2.UnitY;

    }

    // Reflect the velocity about the normal.
    _ballVelocity = Vector2.Reflect(_ballVelocity, normal); 
}

// Set the new position of the ball.
_ballVelocity = newPosition;
</code></pre>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p><a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.UnitX"><strong>Vector2.UnitX</strong></a> is <span class="math">\((1, 0)\)</span> and <a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.UnitY"><strong>Vector2.UnitY</strong></a> is <span class="math">\((0, 1)\)</span>. We use these to get the screen edge normal since the edges of the screen are not at an angle. For more complex surfaces, you would need to calculate the appropriate normal vector based on the surface angle.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="optimizing-collision-performance">Optimizing Collision Performance</h3>
<p>When checking for collisions between multiple objects, testing every object against every other object (often called brute force checking) becomes inefficient as your game grows. Brute force checking can be calculated as <span class="math">\((n * (n - 1)) / 2\)</span> where <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is the total number of objects. For example, if you have 100 objects in your game, that's <span class="math">\((100 * 99) / 2 = 4950\)</span> collision checks every frame. To improve performance, we can use a two-phase approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>Broad Phase: A quick, simple check to rule out objects that definitely are not colliding.</li>
<li>Narrow Phase: A more precise check that is only performed on objects that have passed the broad phase.</li>
</ol>
<p>For our simple game with just two objects, this optimization is not necessary. However, as you develop more complex games, implementing a broad-phase check can significantly improve performance.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Time to get back to the code! The fun starts again here.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="the-circle-struct">The Circle Struct</h2>
<p>For our game, we are going to implement circle based collision detection. MonoGame does not have a <code>Circle</code> struct to represent a circle like it does with <a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Rectangle"><strong>Rectangle</strong></a>. Before we can perform circle collision, we will need to create our own.</p>
<p>In the root of the <em>MonoGameLibrary</em> project, add a new file named <code>Circle.cs</code>. Add the following code as the foundation of the <code>Circle</code> struct:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">using System;
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework;

namespace MonoGameLibrary;

public readonly struct Circle : IEquatable&lt;Circle&gt; 
{
    
}
</code></pre>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Notice that the struct has declared it will implement the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iequatable-1"><code>IEquatable&lt;T&gt;</code></a> interface. When creating value types like this, it is recommended to implement <code>IEquatable&lt;T&gt;</code> because it has better performance for comparing objects and can help avoid boxing.</p>
<p>For more information on recommended design guidelines for structs, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/struct">Struct Design - Framework Design Guidelines | Microsoft Learn</a></p>
<p>Ignore the red squiggles for now, they will be resolved as we add more code.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="circle-fields">Circle Fields</h3>
<p>The <code>Circle</code> struct uses both private and public fields to store its state.</p>
<p>First, add the following private static field that stores a reusable empty circle:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">private static readonly Circle s_empty = new Circle();
</code></pre>
<p>Next, add the following public fields that define the circle's position and size:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// The x-coordinate of the center of this circle.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public readonly int X;

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// The y-coordinate of the center of this circle.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public readonly int Y;

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// The length, in pixels, from the center of this circle to the edge.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public readonly int Radius;
</code></pre>
<p>These public fields store the fundamental properties of the circle:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> define the center point location.</li>
<li><code>Radius</code> defines how far the circle extends from its center.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="circle-properties">Circle Properties</h3>
<p>The <code>Circle</code> struct provides properties to access its location, state, and its boundaries.</p>
<p>Add the following property to get the location of the circle as a <a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Point"><strong>Point</strong></a> value:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Gets the location of the center of this circle.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public readonly Point Location =&gt; new Point(X, Y);
</code></pre>
<p>Add the following properties to track empty circles:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Gets a circle with X=0, Y=0, and Radius=0.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public static Circle Empty =&gt; s_empty;

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Gets a value that indicates whether this circle has a radius of 0 and a location of (0, 0).
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public readonly bool IsEmpty =&gt; X == 0 &amp;&amp; Y == 0 &amp;&amp; Radius == 0;
</code></pre>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The <code>Empty</code> property returns a reusable instance of an empty circle stored in the private static field <code>s_empty</code>. This is more efficient than creating new empty circles each time one is needed, as it reuses the same instance in memory.</p>
</div>
<p>Add the following properties for getting the circle's boundaries:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Gets the y-coordinate of the highest point on this circle.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public readonly int Top =&gt; Y - Radius;

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Gets the y-coordinate of the lowest point on this circle.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public readonly int Bottom =&gt; Y + Radius;

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Gets the x-coordinate of the leftmost point on this circle.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public readonly int Left =&gt; X - Radius;

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Gets the x-coordinate of the rightmost point on this circle.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public readonly int Right =&gt; X + Radius;
</code></pre>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>These boundary properties are particularly useful when you need to know the extent of a circle in screen space, such as determining if a circle is visible on screen or creating a bounding box around the circle.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="circle-constructors">Circle Constructors</h3>
<p>The <code>Circle</code> struct provides two ways to create a new circle:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Creates a new circle with the specified position and radius.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name=&quot;x&quot;&gt;The x-coordinate of the center of the circle.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name=&quot;y&quot;&gt;The y-coordinate of the center of the circle..&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name=&quot;radius&quot;&gt;The length from the center of the circle to an edge.&lt;/param&gt;
public Circle(int x, int y, int radius)
{
    X = x;
    Y = y;
    Radius = radius;
}

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Creates a new circle with the specified position and radius.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name=&quot;location&quot;&gt;The center of the circle.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name=&quot;radius&quot;&gt;The length from the center of the circle to an edge.&lt;/param&gt;
public Circle(Point location, int radius)
{
    X = location.X;
    Y = location.Y;
    Radius = radius;
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The first constructor accepts individual x and y coordinates for the circle's center.</li>
<li>The second accepts a <a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Point"><strong>Point</strong></a> struct that combines both coordinates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both constructors require a radius value that defines the circle's size.</p>
<h3 id="circle-methods">Circle Methods</h3>
<p>The <code>Circle</code> struct implements several methods to support equality comparison between circles. These methods allow us to check if two circles are identical (have the same center position and radius).</p>
<p>First, add the following method that will check if two circles are overlapping with each other:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Returns a value that indicates whether the specified circle intersects with this circle.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name=&quot;other&quot;&gt;The other circle to check.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;true if the other circle intersects with this circle; otherwise, false.&lt;/returns&gt;
public bool Intersects(Circle other)
{
    int radiiSquared = (this.Radius + other.Radius) * (this.Radius + other.Radius);
    float distanceSquared = Vector2.DistanceSquared(this.Location.ToVector2(), other.Location.ToVector2());
    return distanceSquared &lt; radiiSquared;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next we start implementing the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iequatable-1"><code>IEquatable&lt;T&gt;</code></a> Interface, add the following methods for comparing a circle with another object:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Returns a value that indicates whether this circle and the specified object are equal
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name=&quot;obj&quot;&gt;The object to compare with this circle.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;true if this circle and the specified object are equal; otherwise, false.&lt;/returns&gt;
public override readonly bool Equals(object obj) =&gt; obj is Circle other &amp;&amp; Equals(other);

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Returns a value that indicates whether this circle and the specified circle are equal.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name=&quot;other&quot;&gt;The circle to compare with this circle.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;true if this circle and the specified circle are equal; otherwise, false.&lt;/returns&gt;
public readonly bool Equals(Circle other) =&gt; this.X == other.X &amp;&amp;
                                                this.Y == other.Y &amp;&amp;
                                                this.Radius == other.Radius;
</code></pre>
<p>Next, add the following override for <code>GetHashCode</code> to support using circles in hash-based collections:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Returns the hash code for this circle.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;The hash code for this circle as a 32-bit signed integer.&lt;/returns&gt;
public override readonly int GetHashCode() =&gt; HashCode.Combine(X, Y, Radius);
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, add the following operator overloads to support using == and != with circles:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Returns a value that indicates if the circle on the left hand side of the equality operator is equal to the
/// circle on the right hand side of the equality operator.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name=&quot;lhs&quot;&gt;The circle on the left hand side of the equality operator.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name=&quot;rhs&quot;&gt;The circle on the right hand side of the equality operator.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;true if the two circles are equal; otherwise, false.&lt;/returns&gt;
public static bool operator ==(Circle lhs, Circle rhs) =&gt; lhs.Equals(rhs);

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Returns a value that indicates if the circle on the left hand side of the inequality operator is not equal to the
/// circle on the right hand side of the inequality operator.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name=&quot;lhs&quot;&gt;The circle on the left hand side of the inequality operator.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name=&quot;rhs&quot;&gt;The circle on the right hand side fo the inequality operator.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;true if the two circle are not equal; otherwise, false.&lt;/returns&gt;
public static bool operator !=(Circle lhs, Circle rhs) =&gt; !lhs.Equals(rhs);
</code></pre>
<p>IEquatable interface implemented, red squiggles be gone.</p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>The operator overloads allow you to compare circles using familiar syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">Circle circle1 = new Circle(0, 0, 5);
Circle circle2 = new Circle(0, 0, 5);
bool areEqual = circle1 == circle2;    // Returns true
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we have a struct to represent a circle and check for overlapping, we will update our game to implement collision detection and responses.</p>
<h2 id="adding-collision-to-our-game">Adding Collision To Our Game</h2>
<p>If you run the game right now and move the slime around, you will notice a few issues that can be fixed by adding collision detection and response:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can move the slime outside the bounds of the screen.</li>
<li>Nothing occurs when the slime collides with the bat.</li>
<li>The bat does not move, providing no challenge in the game.</li>
</ol>

<p>The key changes made here are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The field <code>_batPosition</code> was added to track the position of the bat.</li>
<li>The field <code>_batVelocity</code> was added to track the velocity of the bat.</li>
<li>The <code>AssignRandomBatVelocity()</code> method was added which calculates a random x and y velocity for the bat to move at when called.</li>
<li>In <a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game.Initialize"><strong>Initialize</strong></a>, the initial position of the bat is set and <code>AssignRandomVelocity</code> is called to assign the initial velocity for the bat.</li>
<li>In <a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game.Update(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.GameTime)"><strong>Update</strong></a>, collision detection and response logic was added to perform the following in order:
<ol>
<li>A <a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Rectangle"><strong>Rectangle</strong></a> bound is created to represent the bounds of the screen.</li>
<li>A <code>Circle</code> bound is created to represent the bounds of the slime.</li>
<li>Distance based checks are performed to ensure that the slime cannot move outside of the screen, the resolution of which is to perform a blocking response.</li>
<li>A new position for the bat is calculated based on the current velocity of the bat.</li>
<li>A <code>Circle</code> bound is created to represent the bounds of the bat.</li>
<li>Distance based checks are performed to ensure the bat cannot move outside of the screen, the resolution of which is to perform a bounce response.</li>
<li>A collision check is made to determine if the slime and bat are colliding (bat &quot;eating&quot; the slime). If so, the bat is assigned a new random position within the screen and assigned a new random velocity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In <a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game.Draw(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.GameTime)"><strong>Draw</strong></a>, the bat is now drawn using the <code>_batPosition</code> value.</li>
</ol>
<p>Running the game now</p>
<ul>
<li>The bat will start moving with a random velocity and bounce off the edges of the screen</li>
<li>You can move the slime around, but cannot leave the bounds of the screen with the slime.</li>
<li>If you move the slime to collide (&quot;eat&quot;) the bat, the bat will respawn at a new location with a new velocity.</li>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this chapter, you accomplished the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learned about different approaches to collision detection:
<ul>
<li>Distance-based checks for simple proximity detection.</li>
<li>Shape-based checks using circles and rectangles.</li>
<li>Complex polygon checks using SAT.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Understood when to use different collision shapes:
<ul>
<li>Circles for round objects and rotation.</li>
<li>Rectangles for walls and platforms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explored different types of collision responses:
<ul>
<li>Blocking to prevent objects from overlapping.</li>
<li>Triggering events when objects collide.</li>
<li>Bouncing to reflect objects off surfaces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Created reusable components:
<ul>
<li>Implemented a Circle struct for circle-based collision.</li>
<li>Added methods to detect circle intersections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Applied collision concepts to our game:
<ul>

<h2 id="test-your-knowledge">Test Your Knowledge</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>What is the difference between collision detection and collision response?</p>
<p>::: question-answer
Collision detection is determining when two objects overlap or intersect, while collision response is what happens after a collision is detected (like blocking movement, triggering events, or bouncing objects off each other).
:::</p>
</li>
<li><p>When using Rectangle.Intersects for AABB collision, what four conditions must all be true for a collision to occur?</p>
<p>::: question-answer
For two rectangles A and B to collide:</p>
<ol>
<li>A's left edge must be less than B's right edge.</li>
<li>A's right edge must be greater than B's left edge.</li>
<li>A's top edge must be less than B's bottom edge.</li>
<li>A's bottom edge must be greater than B's top edge.</li>
</ol>
<p>:::</p>
</li>
<li><p>When implementing circle collision, why do we compare the distance between centers to the sum of the radii?</p>
<p>::: question-answer
Two circles are colliding if the distance between their centers is less than the sum of their radii. If the distance is greater, they are separate. If the distance equals the sum of radii, they are just touching at one point.
:::</p>
</li>
<li><p>When implementing bounce collision response, what two pieces of information does <a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.Reflect(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2,Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2)"><strong>Vector2.Reflect</strong></a> need?</p>
<p>::: question-answer
<a href="xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2.Reflect(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2,Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector2)"><strong>Vector2.Reflect</strong></a> needs:</p>
<ol>
<li>The incoming vector (direction the object is moving).</li>
<li>The normal vector (direction perpendicular to the surface being hit).</li>
</ol>
<p>:::</p>
</li>
<li><p>Why might you choose to use circle collision over rectangle collision for certain objects?</p>
<p>::: question-answer
Circle collision might be chosen because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is more accurate for round objects.</li>
<li>It handles rotating objects better.</li>
<li>It is simpler for continuous collision detection.</li>
<li>It is natural for radius-based interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>:::</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the blocking collision response example, why do we store the previous position before handling input?</p>
<p>::: question-answer
We store the previous position so that if a collision occurs after movement, we can reset the object back to its last valid position. This prevents objects from moving through each other by undoing any movement that would cause overlap.
